# spotify_starter

A new Flutter application.

Build the background UI using ColorTween and the Button UI using Hero widgets.
My original plan will be used to extract a user's playlists from their Spotify Accounts, and merge them according to their needs.
All the values used are placeholders, since connecting to the Spotify Web API using the http library for OAuth is quite difficult.

Would love to complete it, but between completing personal projects and academic workload, I somehow always choose the latter.

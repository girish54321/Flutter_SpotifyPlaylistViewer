# spotify_starter

A new Flutter application.

Build the background UI using ColorTween and the Button UI using Hero widgets.
My original plan will be used to extract a user's playlists from their Spotify Accounts, and merge them according to their needs.

Would love to complete it, but between completing personal projects and academic workload, I somehow always choose the latter.
